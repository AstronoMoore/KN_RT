These are the set of 10 X-shooter spectra of AT2017gfo.

All spectra have been flux-calibrated to photometric observations, as well as
corrected for extinction, and shifted to rest frame.

There are 2 columns in each .dat file -- wavelength (in units of AA), and
flux density (in units of erg / s / cm^2 / AA).

These spectra have any noisy regions removed, but versions with these included
exist -- if needed, then get in touch and I can provide these as well.
